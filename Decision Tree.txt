Decision Trees - Expressiveness

A and B
A or B
A xor B

We will use truth table in this case. If A and B, both 
are true than we will move to next node i.e. from A to B.
If A and B is false then we will not move to any node.

The above condition will change as the gate change.

# Decision tree allows you to have multiple equations 
  to separate the data.

# Decision tree can be used in sklearn(search on google).
