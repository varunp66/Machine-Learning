The Gamma Paramether is used to classify the data. 
Higher the value of Gamma the more data our model will try to classify.

It can classify the data in any form, linear, circle, curve etc.
depending on the value of Gamma we are using.

For eg. if we use gamma = 2^-5(gamma = 2**-5 in the form of python code)
the it will make curve line to classify the data.

If we set gamma = 2^1, then it will try to classify each and every
data point separately.
