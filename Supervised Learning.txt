In Supervised Learning, we feed our system called labeled example.
Labeled example means we give our system some information that
it used to understan the data that we are giving it.

For example: We will give it the images of some person's face
and give it the images of some other faces. And we will tell the
system which image we have to select.

Neural network, Regression, Classification are the different ways
of approaching Supervised Learning. 

Suprvised Classification:

Supervised means we have several examples and we search the correct
answer in those example.
