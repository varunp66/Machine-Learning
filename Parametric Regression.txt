It is a way of building a model by using parameters.
We represent the model with the number of parameters.

As the number of paramters increase, the more accuracy we can get

For eg:   y = mx+c   (would be only a straingt line)

and       y = nx^2+mx+c (Here we have 2 parameters, n and m)
                        (It can make a curved line)
   
                    
Model will get more complex, as the parameters increase and
hence more accurate it will get.
