np.random.seed(0)

It is used to generate the random numbers.
The output is determined by the 'seed' value we are using.

If we have use random.seed = 0, then it will generate the same 
random number output everytime we run the code.

If we change the value of random seed then it will generate
different output everytime we run the code.

Convergence Tolerance(Threshold)

tol = 1e-8

It actually tells the model when to stop learning. Like when we start
to get a desaired output, then we can set a Threshold, means at that
point the model will stop learning.
