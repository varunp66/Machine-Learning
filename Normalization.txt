Normalization refers to a process that makes something more normal or regular.

Database normalization, or simply normalization, is the process of organizing 
the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a relational database to reduce 
data redundancy and improve data integrity.

Normalization involves arranging attributes in relations based on dependencies 
between attributes, ensuring that the dependencies are properly enforced by database 
integrity constraints.
