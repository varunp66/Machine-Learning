''' In this exercise, you will compute and plot the training and testing accuracy
scores for a variety of different neighbor values. By observing how the
accuracy scores differ for the training and testing sets with different
values of k, you will develop your intuition for overfitting and underfitting.

Note: The code may not work, but it is good to understnad the basics.  '''
