The SVM is a classification algorithm which divides the data
in the best possible way.

The points close to the line are called Support Vectors and the line
is called Hyperplane.

It is also called a Constrained Optimization problem. Where Constrains
are the points and the Optimization is the line and we are trying to 
obtain the maximum distance possible between the line and the points.

Pros:

- It is good at dealing with high dimensional data.
- It works well on small data sets.

Cons:

- It could be computationally intensive if we don't use the right
  Kernal and Parameters.
