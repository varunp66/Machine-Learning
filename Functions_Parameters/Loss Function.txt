This is the funcion that we calculate by assigning panalty to the points
that are aligned incorrectly.

Like if ther are blue and red dots and some of the red dots are in the  
regoin of blue dots and vice versa. Then the points that are miss-classified
would be give high penalty and the points that are correctly calssified
would be given low penalty.

Hence by adding all the penalites we can calculate our loss function.

Our main aim is to reduce the value of Loss Function.
