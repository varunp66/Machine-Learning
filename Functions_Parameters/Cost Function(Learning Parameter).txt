In ML, cost functions are used to estimate how badly models are performing. 
Put simply, a cost function is a measure of how wrong the model is in terms 
of its ability to estimate the relationship between X and y.
This cost function (which is also called loss or error function) 
can be estimated by iteratively running the model to compare estimated 
predictions against "ground" truth?the known values of y.
