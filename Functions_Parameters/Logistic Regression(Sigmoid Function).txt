Logistic Regression is used for Classification Problems.
Like whether emails are spam or not, transactions fraud/not fraud.

The value of logistic regression lies between 0 and 1 on y-axis 
i.e. it is used to predict probability.

The logistic regression is used for Binary Classification i.e.
when we have two values.

The logistic regression is also called Sigmoid Function or Activation
Function. The main aim of using this function is to map all the 
obtained values between 0 and 1. In other words, we change the values
in the form of Probability. 

Like if we obtain the value 0 then it is mapped as 0.5. If we get
5 then it would be mapped as 0.99. If we get -10 then it would be
mapped as 0.0001.
(NOTE: It is not necessary that the values will always change to 
the numbers mentioned above. It is just for explanation)

The Sigmoid Function(Activation Functiion) is expressed in the 
equation in the form of:

f(x) = 1/1+e^-x
