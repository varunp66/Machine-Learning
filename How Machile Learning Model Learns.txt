The Python classes or Libraries have mainly two purposes:

1: First they implement the algorithm for learning the model and
   also makes predictions.
2: These algorithms also stores all the informations that is learned from the data.


Training the model on data is also called fitting the model to the data.

We use .fit() method to train our model.

We use .predict() method to predict the unlabeled data.


knn.fit(iris['data'], iris['target']

where, 'data' is the Features and 'target' is the Labels.

The data could be in the from of IRIS data set or in the for of Pandas DataFrame.
Hence we have to choose syntax accordingly.
