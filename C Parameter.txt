The C Parameter is used to ignore the data. Like when data is too 
much crowded and our model can't classify it easily, then we can
use C Parameter to ignore that data. 

Like if we set the value of C= -5, then our model will try to ignore
that data and 
If we set the value of C = 5,then our model will try to Ideantify
that data.
