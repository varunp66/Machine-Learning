In linear regression we draw a certain line, which can pass
through all the points of the data. The closer the line to
to the points. The higher would be the accuracy.

The main equation of linear regression is:

y = mx + c

The line could have any order(power)

Eg.  y = a^5+b^3+c

# Higher order polynomials helps in making a curved line
  which can pass through several points and can increase
  the accurecy.

Polynomial Regression:

In this we multiply one matrix with another.

Linear Regression Error Calculation:

Error = Actual - Predicted


[1 2]      [3 5]
