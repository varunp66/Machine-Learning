-  In Pooling we choose a window/square of 2-3 cells and make it move all
over the image and for each window we take the maximum value.

This helps us in reducing the overall size of the actual image
For eg. If the image is of 7x7 pixels, then after using pooling of 2 window
the size of the image will reduce to 4x4 pixels. This output, that we obtain is 
called Max Pooling.

The pooling makes it easire when we work on the images of high size. Like 
9000x9000 pixels. The pooling can reduce it to 500x500 pixels.


-  The other thing Pooling does is that it doesn't care where in the window
the maximum value occurs. It just place it in the cell to reduce the size.
